# Evolu Relay

Evolu Relay provides sync and backup for Evolu clients. While it's possible to sync and backup Evolu clients among themselves (P2P), it's not practical because devices are often offline and geographically close. Backups should be stored in locations that are geographically distant from each other to ensure protection against local disasters. Evolu Relay is a simple message buffer and storage generic for all Evolu apps. Only `OwnerId` and `Timestamp` are visible. Everything else is encrypted.

Evolu Relay is open-sourced and anyone can easily run their own.

<Note>
  We provide a free `free.evoluhq.com` relay for testing. Our super secret
  master plan on how to make money on that is simple: We will write apps on top
  of Evolu.

## Hosting Evolu Relay

The Evolu Relay source code along with the Docker files can be found in the `/app/relay` directory.
